*Thinking Differently*

Steve Jobs has passed away and the world has lost someone that showed what could be accomplished with a singular and distinctive vision. His was an approach that fused usability, appearance and functionality into a cohesive whole. I’ve read many of the tributes and articles and two of which that stood out from me were ons that showed him on a more personal level as told by Stephen Wolfram and Al Alcorn.

My condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

For my tribute, I’ll simply list a few of his quotations that helped focus his efforts on his and his team’s achievements.

## 1. Inspiration

* “We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn’t build the Mac for anybody else. **We built it for ourselves.** We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren’t going to go out and do market research. **We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.**”
* “Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. **It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’re led, and how much you get it.**”

## 2. Design

* “Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. **The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.**”
* “That’s been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. **Simple can be harder than complex**: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because **once you get there, you can move mountains**.”
* “Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it’s really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn’t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. **To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it’s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something**, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don’t take the time to do that.”

## 3. Marketing

* “We’ve never worried about numbers. In the market place, Apple is trying to focus the spotlight on products, because products really make a difference. […] Ad campaigns are necessary for competition; IBM’s ads are everywhere. But **good PR educates people; that’s all it is. You can’t con people in this business. The products speak for themselves.**”
* “**It’s not about pop culture, and it’s not about fooling people, and it’s not about convincing people that they want something they don’t. We figure out what we want.** And I think we’re pretty good at having the right discipline to think through whether a lot of other people are going to want it, too. That’s what we get paid to do. We just want to make great products.”
* “Our DNA is as a consumer company – **for that individual customer who’s voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That’s who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience.** And if it’s not up to par, it’s our fault, plain and simply.”

## 4. Recruiting

* “Recruiting is hard. It’s just finding the needles in the haystack. You can’t know enough in a one-hour interview. So, in the end, it’s ultimately based on your gut. How do I feel about this person? What are they like when they’re challenged? **I ask everybody that: ‘Why are you here?’** The answers themselves are not what you’re looking for. It’s the meta-data”
* “When I hire somebody really senior, competence is the ante. They have to be really smart. But the real issue for me is, Are they going to fall in love with Apple? Because **if they fall in love with Apple, everything else will take care of itself.** They’ll want to do what’s best for Apple, not what’s best for them, what’s best for Steve, or anybody else.”
* “We’ve had one of these before, when the dot-com bubble burst. What I told our company was that we were just going to invest our way through the downturn, that we weren’t going to lay off people, that **we’d taken a tremendous amount of effort to get them into Apple in the first place – the last thing we were going to do is lay them off.**”

## 5. Managing

* “So **when a good idea comes, you know, part of my job is to move it around, just see what different people think**, get people talking about it, argue with people about it, get ideas moving among that group of 100 people, get different people together to explore different aspects of it quietly, and, you know – just explore things.”
* “**My job is to not be easy on people. My job is to make them better.**”

## 6. Revenue

“A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. **Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.**”

## 7. Discipline

* “**People think focus means saying yes** to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. **It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.** You have to pick carefully.”

## 8. Follow Your Heart

* “Almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.”
* “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. **There is no reason not to follow your heart.**”
