On February 3, [Fox-IT](https://www.fox-it.com/) posted a blog article on [malicious advertisements being served via Yahoo!](https://blog.fox-it.com/2014/01/03/malicious-advertisements-served-via-yahoo/) which was then [discussed by CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2014/01/05/tech/yahoo-malware-attack/index.html). The compromise was active from December 31, 2013 to February 3, 2014.

Fox-IT identified a single IP address that was used to deliver the exploit kit and based on their same traffic, they estimated visits to the site at around 300k/hr. With a typical infection rate of 9%, this would result in a rate of 27,000 infections per hour. The countries most affected were identified as are Romania, Great Brittain and France

## Infection Flow Chart

The following chart is from [Fox-IT’s blog article](https://blog.fox-it.com/2014/01/03/malicious-advertisements-served-via-yahoo/) and shows how an ad injected in a user’s web page browsing ultimately leads to the installation of an exploit kit.

Fox-IT indicates that a number of different exploit kits were used including the ZeuS kit which has been [posted on Github](https://github.com/Visgean/Zeus).
