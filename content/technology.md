## Engine

My personal blog has been powered by several different blog engines over the years. The following evolution has focused on the following:

1. **Easy Editing:** I've found most blog systems to be easy to author, but some systems are harder to get themes to line up correctly for all features.
1. **Easy Upgrade:** Upgrading systems like databases and language compilers are okay when you have 1 blog but easily become complicated when you are running several, like 5-10.
1. **Easy Migration:** Migrating to a different blog ssystem can be challenging if there are no export tools. I've migrated [to Medium](https://github.com/grokify/go-medium) [from Wordpress](https://github.com/grokify/wordpress-xml-go/blob/master/wordpressxml.go)  and it was okay but not somethiing I would like to do for multiple sites.
1. **Easy Hosting:** Having your own server means running something like WordPress is doable, but why not make hosting super simple like on GitHub pages, or perhaps Heroku.
1. **Easy Archival:** Storage of files that are many years old for accessibility can be a challenge if they are in different formats. Markdown files in `git` fit the bill here.

After going through several iterations of blog engines, a big focus is making hosting a blog as easy as hosting open source code and documentation.
