      <description>Stack Overflow is a great site for programming Q&amp;amp;A in general and a great resource for growing developer programs as well. From a developer program perspective, 2000 reputation is an ideal target since it provides the ability to edit any post, treating Stack Overflow more like a wiki, and the ability to create tags.
When I was brought on as the head of Platform Product Management at RingCentral, I was also given the responsibility for building up our community efforts.</description>
