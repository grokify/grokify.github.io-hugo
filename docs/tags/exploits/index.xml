      <description>On February 3, Fox-IT posted a blog article on malicious advertisements being served via Yahoo! which was then discussed by CNN. The compromise was active from December 31, 2013 to February 3, 2014.
Fox-IT identified a single IP address that was used to deliver the exploit kit and based on their same traffic, they estimated visits to the site at around 300k/hr. With a typical infection rate of 9%, this would result in a rate of 27,000 infections per hour.</description>
