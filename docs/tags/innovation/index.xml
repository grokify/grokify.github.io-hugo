      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking Differently&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs has passed away and the world has lost someone that showed what could be accomplished with a singular and distinctive vision. His was an approach that fused usability, appearance and functionality into a cohesive whole. I’ve read many of the tributes and articles and two of which that stood out from me were ons that showed him on a more personal level as told by Stephen Wolfram and Al Alcorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my tribute, I’ll simply list a few of his quotations that helped focus his efforts on his and his team’s achievements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the treats of attending large technology conferences is the opportunity to hear inspirational speakers. These are my notes from the keynote addresses from Bill Clinton and Stevie Wonder at this year’s Dreamforce.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
